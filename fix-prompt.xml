    we are working on the book: Actual  Intelligence. 
    It is written in markdown and stored in GitHub repo: `iksnae/actual-intelligence`.
    Leveraging GitHub Actions and the `build` github workflow automatically compiles the book in multiple formats, which are bundled as a release in the same repo. 
    Recently, we started to switch our build dependencies from local scripts, to using our custom `book-tools` solution in concert with our custom docker image `book-builder`.

    These are respectively defined in their GitHub repositories, which are also ours and your have direct access to:
    - `book-tools`: `iksnae/book-tools` - Custom Book Building CLI that with relies on `book-builder` image.
    - `book-builder`: `iksane/book-builder` - Custom Docker Image providing dependencies and build environment.    
    We have made the migration from custom scripts in the `actual-intelligence` book repo, however in the process we lost support for cover and in-book images, which worked before this migration.
    
    The last commit in `actual-intelligence` that leveraged the scripts and built book with images was: `5fd450bb61c8aeb167441079f4df67480f29ef86`.
    Those local scripts were removed from this repo during the migration, but are still in the repository's history. 
    Placeholder images were NEVER including in the design of this solution. NEVER EVER user placeholder images of artwork.
