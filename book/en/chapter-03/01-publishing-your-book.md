Now that you've created your book, it's time to share it with the world!

## Creating a PDF

The PDF version of your book is perfect for:
- Printing physical copies
- Sharing a professional-looking document

Your PDF is automatically created when you build your book and will be available in the `build` folder.

## Creating an E-book

The EPUB version of your book works with:
- Most e-readers
- Apple Books
- Google Play Books
- Many other reading apps

Like the PDF, your EPUB file is created automatically and will be in the `build` folder.

## Sharing Your Book

Here are some ways to share your finished book:

### Self-Publishing Options
- Amazon KDP for both print and Kindle versions
- IngramSpark for wide distribution
- Lulu, BookBaby, or other print-on-demand services

### Digital Sharing
- Email the files directly to friends and family
- Upload to your website for download
- Use services like Gumroad to sell digital copies

### Using GitHub
If you're using GitHub to store your book, you can:
- Use GitHub Releases to make your book available for download
